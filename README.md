### üí∞ ExpenseController

Allows users to record shared expenses.

#### Endpoints:

- `POST /expenses`

  - Adds a new expense where the amount is split equally among all participants
  - Request Body:
    ```json
    {
      "description": "Dinner",
      "amount": 1500,
      "paidByEmail": "krish@example.com",
      "participantEmails": ["krish@example.com", "janhvi@example.com", "harsh@example.com"]
    }
    ```
  - Returns: the expense details along with amount owed and amount to receive by each user

- `GET /expenses/by-user?email=xyz@example.com&showParticipants=true`

  - Fetches expenses that involve the given user
  - Optional flag `showParticipants` to include participant-level breakdown

---

### üßæ BalanceController

Calculates what users owe to each other.

#### Endpoints:

- `GET /balances/raw?email=xyz@example.com`

  - Returns non-simplified balances (who owes what to whom)
  - Response includes net balance and individual transactions

- `GET /balances/simplified?email=xyz@example.com`

  - Returns simplified debts with minimum transactions needed
  - Useful for final settlement of dues

---

## üì• Postman Collection

If you'd like to try out all the APIs quickly, a Postman collection is available in the root directory of the project (alongside the README and pom.xml). You can import it into your Postman workspace to easily test all available endpoints.

---

## ‚úÖ Example Use Case

1. Create users A, B, and C.
2. A pays ‚Çπ900 for a meal with all three participating.
3. Each owes ‚Çπ300. The app tracks who paid and who owes whom.
4. View `GET /balances/raw` and `GET /balances/simplified` for A to see detailed and optimized summaries.

---

## üìå Notes

- All amounts are split equally among participants.
- Each expense must include the payer in the list of participants.
- The simplified API uses a greedy algorithm to minimize total number of transactions.
